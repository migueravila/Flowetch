### Customization

This fetch Is thought to be used as a personal fetch and have your own fork of it (That's why It doesn't work for all distros or have a lot of ASCII art)

##### Packages:

- The fetch is already configured for Arch Based distros: `pacman -Qq | wc -l`
- If you're on Debian based distros use: `dpkg -l | wc -l`
- If you're on a Fedora based distro use: `rpm -qa | wc -l`


##### Art:

```shell
ARTR1="${c0}  \    /\    "
ARTR2="${c0}   )  ( ')   "
ARTR3="${c0}  (  /  )    "
ARTR4="${c0}   \(__)|    "
